## Objectives
-   Draw simple wireframes to mock up a web page.
-   Contrast wireframes with mockups.

## Sketching and Wireframing

### What Is a Wireframe?

A **wireframe** is an image that sketches out the layout of major pieces of content within a page, without all of the fully-rendered detail that might be present in an illustration.

Although making detailed, feature-rich wireframes is typically the province of the UX/UI designer, even developers can produce basic layout sketches, and these sketches are extremely useful in the planning process as a tool to clarify and codify your vision. They also segue easily into mocking up a site with boxes, so that you know how to actually build your layout.

### Wireframes vs Mockups
Wireframes and mockups are ways to visualize an application. They differ in the the "degree" of fidelity.  Wireframes are lower fidelity, often using placeholders for content, no colors, no fonts, and no assets.  Mockups are are higher fidelity, often utilizing colors, typography, images, and other assets.

**Low-fidelity:**
- wireframes (paper or marker)
- wireframes (digital)

| Pros  |  Cons  |
| ------|----|
| speed | uninspring |
| easy to change | vague |
| inexpensive | feel incomplete |
| skeleton of application | lack of guidance |


### Wireframing in Hackathons

I am not expecting you to produce designer-level wireframes; however, you should produce low-fidelity sketches for your all your projects. A low-fidelity wireframe or sketch is simple -- just complex enough to convey the gist of the page -- and may feature minimal text, placeholders for images, or skeletons of interactive features like drop-down menus and pop-ups or modals.

It should usually not concern itself with things like:
*   color scheme
*   fonts
*   specific content (images, written copy, etc)
*   animations and timing

If you find yourself diving into those details, you may be going too deep. The purpose of a sketch is to be light, flexible, and even disposable if necessary.

In general, since hand-drawn wireframes are easier to iterate on and maintain than computer-drawn ones, I recommend you do all your wireframing today by hand and explore wireframming programs such as Balsamiq Mockups in your own time.

#### Lab

Individually, pick one of the eight following sites and draw a basic sketch for the site on a piece of paper. Focus on capturing the key elements of layout for the page, but **DO NOT INCLUDE ANY REAL TEXT**. When you're finished, rotate within your table (A->B, B->C, etc.) and see if you can identify your neighbor's site using only their sketch. Then, take a few minutes and give each other feedback on the sketches, specifically pointing out aspects that were more clear or less clear.

## User Stories

Once you have constructed wireframes, to better understand your Users, you must construct User stories to identify each pathway they may want to take through your app or website.

User stories exist in different formats, but this is one that works quite well:

_As a **[role]**, I want to **[goal]** so I can **[benefit/purpose]**_

For example:

- _As a user, I want to read reviews of a selected book to help me decide whether to buy **_
- _As an admin, I want to update the inventory of a selected book so my users know what is available.**_

Integrating with Wireframe: 
Add a user story for each part of your wireframe. If you add a button, explain the purpose of that button and why that adds value to your application.


## Final Challenge
Create a wireframe with user stories for an app that tackles one of the civic challenges!
